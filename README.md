# Hey 👋

I'm a developer learning by building small things and improving them step by step.  
Still figuring things out, and enjoying the process.

## 🧩 Currently exploring

```rust
let learning = vec!["Rust", "Dart"];
```

Most of my experience is with JavaScript and Python.  
Lately, I've been learning Rust for systems fundamentals and Flutter for mobile apps.
